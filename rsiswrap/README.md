# RSIS Wrapper
This tool takes in the RSIS IDL format and outputs various autogenerated files based on what is requested. This tool identifies what is being requested based on the name of the file that is passed to it.

| Output | File Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model Wrapper | `idl.toml` | Definitions of structures used by the interface of the model |
| Table | `table.toml` | Definition of the structures by the table |

This tool provides both autogeneration and a generic validation of the IDL used by RSIS.

## DataTypes
The following data types are supported. Only datatypes with a fixed size are allowed for usage in the input and output data structures. `ndarray` is used to support multidimensional arrays.

The following primitive datatypes are allowed in all circumstances:
| Format | Datatypes |
| --- | --- |
| Integers | isize, i8, i16, i32, i64, usize, u8, u16, u32, u64 |
| Floating | f32, f64 |
| Complex | Complex&lt;f32&gt;, Complex&lt;f64&gt; |
| Other | bool, char |

The following datatypes are only allowed within the `data` & `params` structures of model wrappers:
| Format | Datatypes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String | String | |
| Vector | Vec&lt;T&gt; | `T` must be a primitive or String |
| HashMap | HashMap&lt;K, V&gt; | `K` and `V` must be primitives or String |
| BTreeMap | BTreeMap&lt;K, V&gt; | `K` and `V` must be primitives or String |
